# Titanic ML Classifier

This project is a **machine learning classification** that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various features. Using **Decision Trees**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, and **Logistic Regression**, we analyze the factors influencing survival.

## Dataset

The dataset is obtained from **Kaggle** and contains 1,047 passengers with 14 features:

- **PClass**: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard
- **Fare**: Fare paid for the ticket
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
- **Boat**: Lifeboat number
- **Body**: Whether the body was found
- **Survived**: Target variable (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
